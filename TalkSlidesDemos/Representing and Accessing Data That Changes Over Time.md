## Description

This talk answers the question “What’s a clean way to represent data that changes over time?” How could one best model a loan with a variable interest rate? The fluctuating price of one's favorite cereal?

We can store the things that change over time (variable attributes) in one table and stable attributes in a different table. This makes it easy to store and lookup data that changes over time without unnecessarily duplicating information.

We’ll start by looking at some examples of real-world entities with variable attributes we might want to represent. Then, I'll go over how my team worked with variable attributes - from how we represented those attributes in the database to how we displayed those varying attributes to the user.
